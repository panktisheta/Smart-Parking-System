# Smart-Parking-System
This project is to implement a smart parking system wherein the driver gets notified about the vacant spaces the in the parking lot.

##**Why do we need a smart parking system?**
With increase in the population of the vehicles in metropolitan cities, road congestion is the major problem that is being faced.
IoT based parking system is a smart way to automate the management of the parking system that allocates an efficient parking space using internet of things technology.
The IoT provides a wireless access to the system and the user can keep a track of the availability of the parking area.

##**Overview of the Project**
An Arduino Uno, LCD 16x2 with I2C Module, IR sensors, Breadboard will be needed to implement this project. 
The code is uploaded to the Arduino that is connected to the IR sensors and the LCD. When a slot is oocupied, the LCD will display the message about that particular spot being occupied will also show if any vacant slot is remaining.
